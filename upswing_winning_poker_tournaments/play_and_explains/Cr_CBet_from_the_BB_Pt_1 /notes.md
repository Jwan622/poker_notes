- You can CR K3cc on a A59c rainbow board from the BB vs CO. You have 2 backdoors and a K blocker against AK. the CO should call with backdoors here sometimes because there won't be heat on the turn against good players who are c/r with backdoors themselves. You can also c/c in this spot too.

- 2Ko is an easy defend vs MR from BTN (MR = minraise). Flop is 2QcTc and we have Kc2h. we have bottom pair blocker. Nick.P thinks BTN should be folding 22 preflop OTB with 28bb. 
  - Reasons: 22 blocks auto fold hands when you raise OTB vs BB. We block 2 pair too like Q2s from the BTN even though our blocker isn't great since BTN shouldn't be opening that many 2s into BB. We have BD SD and FD so Nick.P does CR. We block KQ with the K in our hand. 5c on the turn giving us a 4 flush with our Kc so we have to go for it. He might fold QJo which is a real hand since ICM at a final table (this hand took place at a final table). Opponent can call the flop C/r with A5hh with a backdoor FD which is cool.
  

- 54o in the BB with 40bb effective. never bluff. Just Kx stuff and Ax stuff is what we 3 bet vs 40 bb. some bad Ax and use the offsuit ones at 40bb. our 3 bet range is Kxo or Qxo or Axo or suited bways. Flop is A39hhh and we have 5h4c, we should C/r this hand. We block flushes and we have a wheel gutter. Opponent is probably going to cbet and autofold the monotone A high a lot.

- we defend J8o from HJ open 100bb. Flop: Qc9d6c. We have a gutter and a Jc for the BDFD. We CR. and our J and 8 are blockers on some runouts for straights. like if a K comes, we have a J for a TJ blocker. We block some TP with the J (he can't have as many QJ). Nick.P complains that in a pot of 400 with 4800 behind, HJ bets 200 and Nick. P makes it 800 which leaves him 2 SPR on the turn. The pot would be 2000 and we would have 4000 which isn't enough to bet and leave yourself pot on the river. If we made it 600, then the pot would be 1600 and we'd have 4200 so we could bet 800 and leave ourself 3400 for a river shove in a pot of 3200. **Take away is on the turn leave yourself a SPR of greater than 2**. A good SPR is 2.6 on the turn. Nick.P wants a good CR range here. He might flat AQo in the BB vs HJ open plenty and will CR on Qc96c to get it in with 40bb.

- If you do CR the flop on say 4sQs on 2cKc3s you should leave opponent with pot on the turn so you can shove if you pickup equity.

- 80-160 blinds, 7200 effective. We defend 57o in the BB vs MP1 open. Flop is Tc46c. So we should CR 5c7h because we block clubs with the 5c. **Maybe c/c without the 5c on a flush draw flop with the OESD**

- we defend Jh7c in BB vs HJ. Flop is 9c8c5c. We CR because we have the 7c which blocks FD for our opponent.

- 63o is prob the worst hand we're defending vs HJ open 90bb deep. So if we have 6s3c and the flop is 5s7s5c, we don't really have a 5 blocker because the 5s is on the board and we have the 6s. We'd have a 65ss blocker only if we had the 6d or the 6h. Nick does CR 7s sometimes for proection small so that's why his sizing her might include smaller sizes. His smaller CR is pretty much a minraise and he thinks population doesn't call enough with backdoors or A and K highs. Turn is a Tc so the board is 5s7s5d, Tc, Nick P like sbarreling again vs good players because their BD diamond floats like AdXd and KdXd missed so he'd barrel again. He may not barrel on a d turn which puts a BD 4 FD.

- Nick. P opens K6ss from HJ with antes but not 46ss with 100bb.
- 37dd in BB vs MP with 32bb. For the MP opener. Nick. P plays fewer suited connectors and more blockers like suited Kings and KTo and QJo are loosest opens in MP. Flop is Qd2sAd: Nick.P checks, MP bets 2k into 5.4k, Nick can 3 street even after CR but you need to size down lower. Nick.P would rather CR to 5.5k or 5k which is almost 2.5x CR the flop and bet 1/3 turn and shove river. Trying to fold out KJ and KT floats on the turn with a 1/3 pot bet. Nick.P would give up turns that are a bway and bet turn on most 9 or lower.

- 89hh from BB vs UTG 100BB deep. Flop: Ah7c5d. Nick P would CR this flop and give up on a K or Q vs UTG opener. Still barrels a T since AT shouldn't be in range. **Still would barrel low cards for pot**. Nick would also CR 74hh and 76hh which is second pair on this board and a BDFD. Nick P wouldn't bet this A75 flop as UTG all that often vs BB or at least would be less because it interacts with BB more than it does UTG. Nick wouldn't bet KQ for 1/3 pot and would bet less frequently with air than poeple do.

- so with 20BB Nick may not CR as aggressively because he has to shove every turn he picks up equity with. For example with Js2s on a Qs82 board, even with the BDFD and BDSD, Nick should c/c instead vs a small bet vs a 23BB opener. Nick would defend vs LJ with K3s and Q5s and J2s.

- NIck P CR small on JhJd2s with 77 from the BB 60bb deep and it get values from some floats and BD continues like AQss with a BDFD and two overs. If opponent bets 300 into 900, Nick P CR to 800 which is a smaller CR. If you make it bigger you won't get value from BDFD hands and weak continues.

- Btn vs BB HU. Nick P defends with 77 in the BB and does CR a Qh5d4h for value with 7h7d for value. But then when opponent calls, and the turn is a 6d for a double FD on board, nick P decides to turn 77 into a bluff. Super interesting hand .He plans on potting turn and overbetting river.

- Nick P does defend K2ss from BB 50 deep vs UTG + 1. interesting. says easy call.

- Will also defend 87o vs UTG Deep from BB. With 8h7c, he might CR the 5h42h board but c/c is also fine. With the heart blocker he might c/c.  He might c/c because Nick P thinks there are better hands to c/r with like with a 3 or an Ah to block his wheel. We want a 3 to block the wheel or a 2 or a 4 or a 5 to block. An A to block the wheel is fine too.'

- he will c/r JJ 25bb deep after defending with it in BB vs UTG + 1 on 843r. He might c/r with 8s too and so he sizes consistently with other 8s hands to push a little value. small raise is fine with 8s to get value from 55-77 and pushing a little equity, especially 8s with a BD FD and SD like 87 on 843r to protect vs A high c-bets. Linear sizing so smaller with 8s and JJ and 99.
