- 25bb
### LJ 
- open with all suited aces, 8Qs, K5s, A2s, 55, 67s, QTo some JTo. The takeaway is that all suited aces and not 56s are raised and more K5s than you think. K6s is an open. 
- not raising 22-44.

### HJ
- big card removal makes sense which is why we're raising Q8s. 

### CO
- offsuit A5o is fine. and K2s and Q5s. K8o and Q9o and J9o. strong pairs with shallow SPR spots is good and blocking rejam ranges. 54s and 67s are opens again. no 22-33.

#### BTN
jam 22-55 with 25bb, it's fine you can also jam some slivers of strong hands and suited aces too and K4-K7ss.
