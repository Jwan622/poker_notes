with 20bb (not 25), vs BTN, you can reship any pair from the bb vs BTN and reship AK-ATss or offsuit. You can also reship A2-A5o and suited low aces sometimes. flat AA from the BB. flat iwth KJo and mostly KJs (some shove with KJs). some reships with K6s and K7s. Flat with K2o and T2o and T9o. flat any 2 suited. Def flat T2 and 32s.

With 25bb vs EP, we 3 bet AA adn KK because their range is very strong instead of flatting. We flat vs BTN.

- with 25bb vs EP, you can bluff A2-A5o AI against EP. Not the suited aces! They get 3 bet small sometimes too. You can also 3 bet small with QJs and QTs and K7s. AKo is a pure jam and we 3 bet small with AQ adn AKs sometimes. sometimes we jam AQs adn but someitmes we call AQs. TT and JJ are pure jams. Notice we don't defend Kxo and Qxo and Jxo vs early with 25bb as much. Hard to play because the range is so strong. We do defend all suited hands.

- with 25bb vs MP, we can jam K9s and A3-A5s sometimes. We can jam all pairs but 33-66 sometimes. We can jam A8o sometimes. We 3 bet small with AQs and jam AQo. We can 3 bet small as a bluff with A2-A8o. We can 3 bet small asa bluff with KTo and K9o and K7 and K6o because less playability and we have blockers to rejam range.

- with 25bb vs HJ, we can defend K2o and Q2o again. Now we 3 bet AI with JJ and TT and 99 because it dominates some of HJ calling AI range. Our bluffs are still  slivers of offsuit aces. and K9s and Q9s. We can jam AI with slivers of A2-A7o. we can call too. Mostly A2-A8o are clals but you can jam AI slivers. Q2o is a call vs HJ. all suited hands are defends. You can jam some Q9s and K9s because they block value hands and don't block the raise/fold hands.
  
- with 25bb vs CO, We can jam AI with slivers of A2-A7o. AJ-AK are pure jams vs CO. K8 and K9 and A9o we can jam small as a bluff.

- with 25bb vs BTN, you can 3 bet/call with JTs and T9s and 89s, but 78 and 67s are folds. You can jam AI with A2-A5o pure and slivers of A2-A5s. jam At-Ako because they'll get called by worse.
