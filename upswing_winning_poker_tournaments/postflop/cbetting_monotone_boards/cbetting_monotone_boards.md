**932 all hearts**

vs BB, the LJ is betting small a lot on the flop. Kind of interesting because BB has so many auto folds with all the other suited hands. Not making any strong pairs. so the LJ should be betting a lot.
- OOP surprisingly is calling with a lot of flushes OOP. OOP can also CR bluff with 64s without the flush, No heart in hand. 54hh is a call but 54s no heart is a CR. Ah4c is a cr from the BB but Ac4h is a c/c with just the 4h. A little bluffing with 42s without a heart. Bare ace is a CR to pickoff the wide cbet from the BTN. AJ with the Ah is a c/c which is kind of surprising but I guess it has more value than Ah4c with a gutter.

**Th turn**

- LJ should be betting K6s-K8s as a bluff because and Q8s because the BB would c/c flop with KQ and KJ with a heart and these hands block those hands that would call turn again. Those hands obviously have to call turn again. Q8cc blocks KhQ combos that the BB might have c/c the flop with. OOP would never c/r monotone flop with Kh but will with Ah combos.
- LJ should not watn to bluff with A3-A5s of clubs because it blocks 54s 53s that would fold the turn but call flop.  It also blocks A4 and A3 with our ace. A4 and A3 might call with a gutter if we bet the flop 1/3 pot to keep these weak hands and weak 43 and 55 in the pot.
- So we bluff with K8 but not A5o.
- on the river QJcc is a good bluff because the Q reduces the number of Kh combos down from 4 to 3, same with the Jc... it reduces Kh combos from 4 to 3.

-on hte river, we're more likely to bluff again on a blank with QJ and Q8cc than K8cc becuase the Qc in our hand blocks a KhQ combo. But if the Lj has K8cc, it doesn't block any KhQ combos so BB still could have 4 KhQ and 4 KhJ combos. Interesting!
