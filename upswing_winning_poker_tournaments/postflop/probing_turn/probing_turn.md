**4d4s2d LJ vs BB 100bb**
- interestingly, LJ is checking back a lot here, betting mainly diamonds and trips or better. A7-AJs are mainly check backs. A6s is a bet because it blocks hands that would c/r and A3 and A5s are teh same. A3s with a FD or BDFD are betting more than the ones without.
- so because LJ c/b (checkback) range is so strong and because BB is so weak, the best cards to turn probe are the 5,6,7 which hit us more than LJ. LJ prob bets a fair amount of 56s. worst cards are the Q, K, A.
- LJ is checking back AJdd half the time. LJ is betting AsAd always because not getting c/r that often.


**4d4s2d BTN vs BB 100bb**
- BTN can cbet 4d42d with Adx or Kdx more frequently. checks back others. AK is a bet.

**7s6s5d BTN vs BB 100bb**
- LJ checking a lot. QQ without a spade is checking a lot.
- LJ is betting A4ss, A4dd with a BDFD.
- checks: AA without a spade. KK without a spade. 99 is betting a fair amount. - KQ with a spade is betting half the time. AJ with the As is a bet half the time. A8o is a check. A8s is mostly a check but Q8ss is a bet.
- if this goes check check, the 4, 8,9 are high equity cards for teh BB.
- **again, when the 2 comes, our equity distribution is about 50/50 which implies that we bet 40% pot on teh turn more often. Closer equity distributions lead to smaller bets from the BB like 1/3 pot. we dont want to bet big into his range taht is overpairs and overcards... smaller bets make more sense. 7s and 6s aren't worth big bets... we want to fold out overs and get calls from A high and set our price with our draws... smaller bets make sense.**
- if the turn is a 3d, we bet straights big, and also bare 8s.
- IP LJ is checking back AT AQ and AJss half the times. Betting A7ss.
- since LJ has an equity advantage against us on a Jh turn, BB strategy is to bet big or check since gains nothing by betting small. BB needs a fold or a call to gain value
- for BB on a Jh turn, QT and KT are good pot bluffs because they block KJ and QJ, but mostly using FD.
- interestingly, BB checks low FD again on the J turn and may go for the c/r instead.


**7s6s5d BTN vs BB 100bb, Tc turn**
- BB can bet polarized. some high equity hands like K4ss Q4ss that don't mind getting money in the pot but also benefit from an immediate fold. A4ss is a smaller bet because it folds out only weaker hands with a bet.
- equities are close on the T so lots of small betting too in addition to some big betting. a lot of equities are close so some linear betting.
