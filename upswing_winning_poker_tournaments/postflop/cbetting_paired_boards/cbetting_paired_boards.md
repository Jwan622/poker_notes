**cbetting paired boards k33r 100bb effective LJ vs BB**

- should be checking like 70% because we have very few 3s.

**JJ4 with a fd**

**4s4d2d with a FD**
- BB has a polarized range of air and gutters and a 4. BB has more trips. When this happens, we want to protect the middle of our range lik AA-JJ with checks. We check back this flop a lot. We bet 66 but not AA as much.
- Q9ss with a BDFD is a check less often than A6ss with a BDFD
- 66 and 55 are good bets for LJ because it blocks 65 and 5s4s which is part of BB c/r range. 66 also gains value from protection. blocks his value range **AND** bluffs.
- BB should like c/r A3o here because it blocks 34s and A4s; two different suited combos. So LJ's combos of 34s and A4s both decrease if we hold A3o of different suits.K5o without the 5d is  good bluff too and with the Kd. K5ss spades and diamonds are good bluffs.. they
- BB can c/r JTdd which is good because it folds out higher FD sometimes. LJ might fold KQdd.
- LJ can fold AKdd on the turn if the turn is a 6c because it hits so many of his hands that were c/r the flop. BB could have a straight or FH if he  bets the pot.
- vs players that don't c/r as much, we can realize the value with the middle of our range like KK and some fd so we can bet more.


**K33r**
- LJ should check this flop back a lot vs aggressive BB since the BB has threes adn the LJ does not. if LJ does check back turn, BB can overbet turn with a three and some
- BB can c/r K33r flop with 45s with a BDFD, and QJs with a BDFD. Needs to balance with c/r K9s with a BDFD too. can c/r 65ss with a BDFD. Def works even more if LJ thinks they can cbet this flop with impunity and bets stuff like 99 and TT and all kings. Unexploitable is to check more since all the threes are in our range and not the LJ so this is an interesting spot to CR as the BB.
