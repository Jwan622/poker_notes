**KdJc4d LJ vs BTN with QJdd**
- LJ with QJdd should be bet smaller because BB doesn't have as many weak aces. If BB had weak aces, we bet bigger to barrel off weak aces. But here, BB just doesn't have as many of those and so we can bet smaller. BB just acn't call with that many hands once.


**Td43d LJ vs BTN with QJdd**
- PFR should be cbetting a lot even KQ and AQo even without the diamond. You turn equity on the Jack so you can barrel a fair amount of cards next which means you should barrel more. Puts pressure on 4s and 3s which BB has a lot of.


**KdQJ, 3d turn SB 3 bets, BTN calls,SB bets 1/3 pot on flop**
- SB doesn't have to bluff with 67s 78s 89s for NPND. Just bluffs with aces and tens like T8 or A4ss. K5dd with a FD is a check to have some c/c in our range for flushes.
- if SB bet bigger on flop, SB can jam any a high flush draw or AA. 97dd is a jam too.


**8c5d2dQd9c**
- river, OOP can c/r hands like Ad5 or AdT or AdJ. balance with c/r flushes.

**JJ vs LJ in BB**
-call a lot with JJ is good. c/r 843r vs a small bet a lot is what nick does good to balance with 8s.

**8d65d flop**
- if OOP gets 3 bet by IP, IP does hav ea lot of high cards. only 36 overpairs, but lots of unsuited cards. OOP can lead 1/3 pot donk bet into this.
- IP needs to checkback here a lot, especially with KJo.
- say turn is a 3s after a flop check/check, OOP should bet this a lot. OOP has 4s, IP does not. OOP has 7s and 8s, IP has few after a flop check/check.

**Tc25c BB defend with T2ss**
- defend out of BB vs LJ with T2ss.
- BB can c/r flop with K3s and K4cc, A3cc A4cc
- on a Th turn, you can lead sometimes here with FD and Tens. There are 2 flush draws. Maybe don't lead a boat, but maybe lead like KT.
- 9c river, the more you have the board, more you want to make the small bet. Make small bet to induce shoves from busted FD or value raise.

**Ad4d3c with TT from BTN**
- pretty much at 30bb, always cbet A high boards. bet for protection and value
- can call small cr from 2.2 to 5bb.

**J7c4c flop, raise with 76ss from HJ**
- if BB has 15bb and pot is 5bb, checking back 76 here on flop is good.

**CO vs LJ with A5ss 100bb**
- 3 bet, call the rest from 2.1 to 6.2. A5cc in the CO is a fine hand to 3 bet. with 100bb

**K6c5c**
- raise SB with 94ss, you can bet flop with 2 backdoors.

**QTo in the BB vs LJ, 7c53c flop**
- BB always defends here. 3 bets blocker stuff.
- lj prob shouldn't check back JTcc or 89cc which are low FD, but would check back ATcc. nut flush combos are better check backs and king high flush draws teh same.
- 9s turn, because LJ isn't checking back low or mid flush draws... and is more likely to check back AJcc, this is a good spot for BB to bet. the BB actualy hand QTo blocks T8s so that's good. can fold out QJ and ATo in LJ range. JThh and JTdd from LJ are going to check back this flop and fold to turn bet becuase it has no draw or BDFD on flop.
